# PDFEdit.live

Edit PDFs securely in your browser. No uploads, no servers — your files never leave your device.

## Use It Your Way

- **[Use the live version](https://pdfedit.live)** — ready to use, no setup required
- **Run it locally** — clone this repo and build it yourself (see [Development](#development) below)

Both options keep your files completely private. The app runs entirely in your browser either way.

## Your files stay on your device

This editor runs completely in your browser. Your PDFs are never uploaded to any server — everything happens right here on your computer, keeping your documents private and secure.

## Features

### View & Navigate
Scroll through pages, zoom, rotate, and search text. Browse your PDF documents with smooth scrolling, precise zoom controls, and powerful text search.

### Annotate
Highlight text, draw, add shapes and text notes. Mark up your documents with highlights, freehand drawings, shapes, and text annotations.

### Sign Documents
Draw your signature directly on any page. Add your handwritten signature to contracts, forms, and other documents that need signing.

### Edit Pages
Delete, rotate, reorder, and extract pages. Reorganize your PDF by removing unwanted pages, changing page order, or extracting specific pages.

### Merge & Split
Combine multiple PDFs or split into separate files. Merge documents into one or divide a large PDF into smaller files.
